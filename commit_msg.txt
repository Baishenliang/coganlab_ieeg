Re do batch and updated pipeline to solve the D0079 bug

**patients still having problems**

D0079: no anything
D0096: no anything

**patients that are newly done**

D0055
D0057
D0059
D0068
D0069
D0101
D0102

**Issues with D0077**
Did not remove the old D0077 clean derivative, and so line noise filter failed on loading files.

**Issues with D0079**
Same old problem. Memory issues when doing data saving.

**Issues with D0096**
Same to D0077. Did not remove the old D0096 clean derivative.
