Pooled electrodes plot

Things to ask Aaron:
1. Why plot average brain usually be busy and stops
2. How to handle D107
3. If I drop electrodes (eeg and trigger) in line noise filter, will that affect electrode indexing when plotting?
4. If I plot all the electrodes will they overlap together? Or the algorithm will selectively merge the nearest electrodes?
